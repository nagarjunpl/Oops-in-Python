# Abstraction in Python  

## What is Abstraction?
- **Abstraction** is the concept of **hiding the complex implementation details** of a system and **showing only the necessary features** to the user.  
- It helps in **reducing complexity** and **increasing efficiency** in software development.  

Think of it like driving a car:  
- You **use the steering wheel, pedals, and buttons** (the interface).  
- You **donâ€™t need to know how the engine works internally** (hidden complexity).

## In Python (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Abstraction is achieved using **abstract classes** and **methods**.  
- Python provides the `abc` module for defining **abstract base classes**.

## Key Points
- **Hides internal details** and **exposes only the necessary functionality**.  
- Helps in **managing complexity** in large systems.  
- Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.  
- Users interact with **methods/functions**, not the inner workings.

ðŸ’¡ Analogy:
- Think of your **smartphone**: you use apps by clicking icons, but you donâ€™t need to know how each app is coded internally. Thatâ€™s abstraction in real life.
