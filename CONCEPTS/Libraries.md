# 🧩 Python Libraries

A **library** is a collection of pre-written code that helps you perform specific tasks without writing everything from scratch.

You control the flow of the program — you decide **when and how** to use the library.

## ✅ Example:
```python
import math

x = math.sqrt(25)
print(x)
```

Here, you’re calling the `sqrt()` function when you want — so **you’re in control**.

## 🔹 Popular Python Libraries
| Library | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| math | Mathematical operations |
| random | Generate random numbers |
| pandas | Data analysis and manipulation |
| numpy | Numerical computing |
| matplotlib | Data visualization |
| seaborn | Statistical plotting |
| requests | HTTP requests |
| openpyxl | Excel file handling |

## ⚙️ Key Points
- Libraries perform **specific tasks**.
- You **import** and **use** them in your code.
- They are **flexible** — you can use many libraries together.
