# Python OOPs - Daily Learning Log 🧠🐍

Welcome to my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python repository!  
This repo is a structured collection of my **daily learning, examples, and practice exercises** as I explore core OOP concepts in Python. 🚀

---

## 🌱 Building on Python Basics

This repository is a **natural continuation of my [Python Basics - Daily Learning Log](https://github.com/nagarjunpl/python-basics)**,  
where I focused on core programming fundamentals such as:

- Variables
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Functions
- Basic data structures

Now, I'm diving deeper into **Object-Oriented Programming** — a powerful programming paradigm that helps write more modular, reusable, and organized code.

## 📘 What You'll Find Here

Each day, I’ll upload Python files demonstrating one or more OOP concepts, including:

- 🔹 Classes and Objects  
- 🔹 Constructors (`__init__`)  
- 🔹 Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical)  
- 🔹 Polymorphism  
- 🔹 Encapsulation & Abstraction  
- 🔹 Method Overriding and Overloading (workaround in Python)  
- 🔹 Special Methods (`__str__`, `__len__`, etc.)  
- 🔹 Real-world OOP examples and mini-projects

## 📅 Daily Learning Plan

I aim to **consistently upload code snippets, examples, or exercises** that reflect my understanding of Python OOPs.  
Each file will be clearly named and organized by topic.

## 🧑‍💻 Why OOP?

Understanding OOP helps in writing **modular, reusable, and scalable** code.  
It enhances **problem-solving and software design skills**, which are essential for both technical interviews and real-world development projects.

---

## 💡 Goal

To **master the core principles of OOP in Python** and build confidence through daily hands-on practice.  
This effort complements my Python Basics learning and takes me closer to becoming a confident Python developer.
